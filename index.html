<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>As a: tech enthusiast</p>
<p>I want to: leverage github pages</p>
<p>So that: I can track my progress with various projects</p>
<p>I'll know I'm done when: I've created a basic workflow where I start and finish
on simple task and then review that task in preperation for the next one.</p>
